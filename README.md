# News-Portal

This is the README file for a News Portal Website, which is built using JavaScript, PHP, and XAMPP.


## Project Description

The News Portal Website is a dynamic web application that allows both administrators and users to interact with the platform. Administrators have additional privileges to manage news articles, while users can freely read news articles without authentication. The website has the following features:

1. **Article Management (Admin)**: Administrators can create, edit, and delete news articles. Each article includes a title, content, category, and publication date.

2. **News Categories**: The website provides different categories, such as Politics, Sports, Technology, Entertainment, etc., allowing users to browse news articles based on their interests.

3. **Search Functionality**: Users can search for specific news articles based on keywords, category, or publication date.

4. **Read News**: Users can freely read news articles without the need for authentication. They can view the article's title, content, category, and publication date.


## Technologies Used

The News Portal Website is built using the following technologies:

1. **JavaScript**: Used for client-side scripting, enhancing the user interface and interactivity.
2. **PHP**: Used for server-side scripting to handle data processing, interactions with the database, and user authentication (for administration purposes).
3. **XAMPP**: A development environment that includes the Apache web server, MySQL database, and PHP, allowing you to run the website locally during development.


##

Please note that user authentication is not required to read news articles. Users can freely access and read news articles without logging in. However, administrators will still need to authenticate themselves to access the article management features.
